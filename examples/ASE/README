This folder contains examples to illustrate the usage of the BOPfox
ASE (system call) interface which is used in the parameterization. 
All the source codes are in folder src/.
Before you run any of the following examples, make sure that you have
compiled bopfox and setting the path in your bashrc, e.g.

export PATH=<path to bopfox>:$PATH

In addition, the calculator and the io interfaces defined by bopio.py and 
bopcal.py, respectively should be copied to the ase/calculators and ase/io 
folders. You SHOULD rename both of them as bopfox.py inside their respective 
folders. To check if you have done this correctly, try the following in 
python.

from ase.calculators import bopfox as bopcal
from ase.io import bopfox as bopio

If this fails, most probably the path to ASE is not set in your PYTHONPATH. 
Again set the following in your bashrc:

export PYTHONPATH=<path to ase>:$PYTHONPATH

example1.py
   In this example we generate a bopfox calculator and calculate the energy
   of bcc-Fe. First, the calculator is defined by passing the model and infox
   parameters in the BOPfox calculator object. Model can either be a string
   (filename, or path) or a modelsbx object (see example2.py). The latter is 
   used in the fitting code.

example2.py
   In this example we illustrate the use of the modelsbx object defined in
   bopmodel.py
