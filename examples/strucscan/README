This example illustrates the generation of BOPcat reference 
data from strucscan. The interface is strucscan_interface.py and the 
main program that fetches the data is get_strucscan_data.py. 

NOTE : These are only temporary codes that are not meant to be part 
of BOPcat, hence are not necessarily tested nor optimized.
