In this example, two models are combined and optimized.
The initial model starts with the repulsion found in example
"optimize_Fe_Madsen-2011" and the dimer bondintegrals for iron.
The combination of the models leads to a slight shift and increase of the
equilibrium energy for bcc.
The dimer bond integrals are optimized and the repulsion and the embedding
contribution are fixed.
Very tiny changes in the bond integrals lead to a good agreement of the
BOP and DFT data.
Note that not all parameters of the dimer bond integrals are optimized:
The stop distances (which you get from the models.bx file) are
ddsigma [ 3.    1.7   1.35  1.35  1.35  1.35]
ddpi [ 3.   1.4  1.2  1.2  1.2  1.2]
dddelta [ 2.65  1.2   1.2   1.2   1.2   1.2 ]
This means that the simple exponential decay is valid up to (3., 3. 2.65)
A and the first correction up to (1.7, 1.4, 1.2) A. This is already smaller
than the shortest interatomic distance in the reference data. For ddpi a
third fit for interatomic distances up to 1.2 A exists. Due to the lack of
data for interatomic distances smaller than 2.2 A, it does not make sense
to include this fit.
Also the simple exponential decay should be maintained, therefore the
third parameter p_3 is not changed from 1.

procedure is defined in main.py
